        description: "A website created for an esports team me and my friends created that we take too seriously. This was the first time I used React and Webpack for a project so was a big learning curve. I also created a news blog using Jekyll for updates to the team. The OpenDota API is used to display a win-loss graph of the DOTA 2 teams last 10 games. This was also my first time using FTP to upload a site to a webserver, which was another steep learning curve.",
